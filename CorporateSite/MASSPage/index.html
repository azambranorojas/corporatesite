					I designed The Beanz Coffee website. The home page displays a bit of info about the coffee shop as well as their mailing address, email and phone number.  It also has a link to their menu. Their menu shows the various drinks they have available as well as the prices of each drink. Near the top of the menu page, it allows the customer to go back to the home page.
